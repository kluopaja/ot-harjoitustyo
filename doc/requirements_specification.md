# Requirements

## Purpose of the software

The software will be a 2D shoot 'em up flying game similar to
[Sopwith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopwith_(video_game)). The players' goal
is to fly a plane while trying to shoot other players' planes and avoiding to
get shot by others.

## Users

The software will support at least 2 simultaneous players. In the beginning the
game will not have any AI and thus single-player mode will not be very useful.

## UI


## Basic functionality

### Main menu

* The user can start the game
* The user can select a map
* The user can select their username
* The user can quit the game

### Game

* The user can pause the game
* The user can see their current score
* The user can pilot the plane
* Hitting a bullet or ground will damage the plane

### After game

* The user can see their final score
